# ComputerVision
Collection of all my projects related to Computer vision. 

1) Image Filters: A program intended to experiment with linear and non linear kernels on both RGB and Grayscale Images. Kernels used were Mean filter, Gaussian Filter, Sharpening Filter, Median Filter. 
                  Libraries Used were OpenCV, and NumPy
2) Edge Detection : Created a Canny Edge detector, using techniques of convolution to compute the edges of any RGB Picture.
